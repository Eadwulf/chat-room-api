# Description

The `chat-room-api` is an API developed with `Django` and `Django Rest Framework` in addition to other libraries and tools. The idea of this project is to serve as a back-end for a Chat Room (front-end web application) with similarities to ***[Discord](https://discord.com/)*** or similar platforms, in which registered users can join existing chat rooms or create their own and chat with peers. The `chat-room-API` allows for chat rooms, users, and messages to be filtered or searched by query parameters. The API supports token-based authenticated requests and, it's a must to ensure that all the permission and authorization functionalities are applied to the users based on their roles.

### Apply the migrations

```python
python manage.py migrate
```
<br>

# Tests

I have created a total of 34 tests, that test the app `api`, `chatrooms`, and `accounts`.
<br>

### Run the tests
```console
python manage.py test
```

It should return an output such as

```console
Found 34 test(s).

### Tests in api app
A total of 30 tests were included. Each functionality of the endpoints in the API is tested.
The requests made in the tests to the API endpoints are token-based authenticated requests.
<br>

### Tests in the chatrooms app
The tests in the chatrooms app perform CRUD operations on Chatroom and Message models.
<br>

### Tests in the accounts app
The test in the account app performs CRUD operations in the CustomUser model.
